## Overview

Bauble is a cutting-edge chatbot designed to enhance user engagement on VirtuShop, your online shop. Created for Zoho Cliqtrix'24 hackathon, this chatbot seamlessly integrates with Zoho Sales IQ, offering users an intuitive interface to explore products, view deals, and perform various ecommerce actions. The solution is built using CodeIgniter for the backend and Zoho's Deluge scripting language for Bauble's business logic.


## Features

### 1. Dynamic Product Exploration

Bauble allows users to effortlessly browse products through an interactive card-based interface. Users can filter items by category, set price ranges, and check out exclusive deals. The Codeless Bot Builder platform ensures a smooth and dynamic user experience.

### 2. Secure User Authentication

User authentication prioritizes security with an innovative approach â€“ OTP authorization. Instead of traditional login credentials, Bauble uses one-time passwords, ensuring a secure and user-friendly login process.

### 3. Cart Management and Checkout

For logged-in users, Bauble streamlines the shopping process. Users can add items to their cart directly from the chatbot and proceed to checkout effortlessly. The CodeIgniter backend handles API calls securely, managing user actions like cart additions, payments, and order tracking.

### 4. Contextual Communication

Efficient use of context variables in Zoho's Deluge scripting language reduces repetitive tasks and enhances the chatbot's ability to understand and respond to user inputs. Well-named context variables simplify the development process, making Bauble more robust and adaptable.

### 5. Live Order Tracking

Bauble empowers users to track their orders in real-time directly from the chatbot. By authenticating users within the bot, it provides a seamless experience for users to stay updated on their purchases without navigating away from the conversation.


## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Handling Product Datatypes

Managing the 'input carousel card' and handling output in product datatype presented challenges. Debugging Deluge scripts within the Codeless Bot Builder was intricate due to the unique structure of product datatypes. Solutions were devised by carefully studying the official documentation, providing clarity on working with these complex data structures.

### 2. Dynamically Creating Carousels

Creating carousels dynamically required a set of information from the backend application, requested in the plug response. This ensured dynamic and user-centric carousel creation. Meticulously crafted actions for the input carousel enhanced user interaction within Bauble.

### 3. Context Variable Optimization

Naming conventions for context variables played a crucial role in Bauble's efficiency. Strategic naming reduced ambiguity, streamlining communication between different components of the chatbot. Properly named context variables enhanced readability and maintainability of the codebase.


## Unfortunate Announcement

Regrettably, due to unforeseen issues in hosting the backend for Bauble, we are unable to present a live demonstration this year. However, we have prepared a working demo uploaded on YouTube for you to explore. Feel free to check out the bot in action and witness the innovative features we've implemented.
